# HumanBenchmarkPythonScripts
The Human Benchmark is a site that tests your reaction time (https://humanbenchmark.com/). However, since I do not have good reactions, I decided to see how fast I could get my computer to react for me.

To use it, you must have the site loaded on your computer. Make sure to have it on your main moniter if you have more than 1.

Immediately after starting, move the cursor over the banner on the site, and it will do the rest.

It is important to note that, while the program can react very fast, there will still be delay due to communication speed.
